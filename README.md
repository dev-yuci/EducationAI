**EducationAI** is designed to be a supportive companion for students preparing for university entrance exams. This project utilizes the **Gemini API** to generate TYT (Test of Basic Proficiency) and AYT (Test of Subject Proficiency) questions, providing a personalized learning experience.  

Although the project is built using **ASP.NET**, it is still a work in progress. The design is entirely my own, utilizing **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **ASP.NET** alongside **Gemini AI** for question generation.
